## Introduction 
Hello everyone. Looking online, I saw that the "Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction" by William D. Callister was a good, comprehensive introduction to the field. So, I will be hopefully reading a chapter everyday (though some are very long and detailed, and might take more than a day) and write out the solutions to the problems for each chapter at the end of the book so I can retain the information.

## 1.1 

> Select one or more of the following modern items or devices and conduct an Internet search in order to determine what specific material(s) is (are) used and what specific properties this (these) material(s) possess(es) in order for the device/item to function properly. Finally, write a short essay in which you report your findings.

> Cell phone/digital camera batteries, Cell phone displays, Solar cells, Wind turbine blades, Fuel cells, Automobile engine blocks (other than cast iron) Automobile bodies (other than steel alloys), Space telescope mirrors, Military body armor, Sports equipment, Soccer balls, Basketballs, Ski poles, Ski boots, Snowboards, Surfboards, Golf clubs, Golf balls, Kayaks, Lightweight bicycle frames

Materials used in batteries are usually lithium ion batteries. There are many types of lithium ions, like LCO, LMO, LMNCO, LFP and LNCAO. The way these ions are structured allow for efficient charging and energy storage. 

Materials used in phone screens include glass, like silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide. These glasses help protect the screen and increase longetivity.

Materials used in solar cells include silicon. Crystal lattices made up of silicon atoms allow the conversion of light to electricity to be more efficient. 

Materials used in wind turbine blades are mostly composites, with fiberglass-reinforced polymer (GFRP) being the most common. These composites are the strongest and most durable.

Materials used in fuel cells are usually electricity conducing metals. 

Materials used in autombile engine blocks are aluminum alloys. Aluminum alloys are much lighter and allow for heat to be transferred more efficiently.

Materials used in autombile bodies are also aluminum. This is due to the same reasons as above.

Materials used in telescope mirrors include both alloys and composites. Using these materials allows for the mirror and the mount to be one structure, which glass cannot allow. 

Materials used in military body armor is made up of primarily ceramics. This is because they can absorb and disperse the energy of bullets and other weapons aimed at the person. I lowk don't feel like looking up anymore so we are going to move onto the next question.

## 1.2
> List three items (in addition to those shown in Figure 1.9) made from metals or their alloys. For each item, note the specific metal or alloy used and at least one characteristic that makes it the material of choice.
>

1. Aircraft fuselage
    * Material: Aluminum alloy 
    * Key Characteristic: High strength-to-weight ratio; lightweight yet strong enough to handle flight stresses.

2. Kitchen knives

## Conclusion
That was a lot of work, but pretty easy. I think from the next chapter on, I'll do odds only since there is much, much more content and practice problems.
