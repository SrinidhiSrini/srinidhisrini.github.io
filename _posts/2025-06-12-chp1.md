## 1. Introduction 
Hello everyone. Looking online, I saw that the "Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction" by William D. Callister was a good, comprehensive introduction to the field. So, I will be hopefully reading a chapter everyday (though some are very long and detailed, and might take more than a day) and write out the solutions to the problems for each chapter at the end of the book so I can retain the information.
