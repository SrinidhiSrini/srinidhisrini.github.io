## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone. If you didn't know, I recently graduated from Academy of the Canyons (AOC) this month. I thought it would be interesting to reflect on my AOC experience, as well as ask some of my friends about their thoughts, so that's what this post is going to be about.

## 2. My thoughts

Honestly, I'm not sure where to start. There is just so much about AOC that we can talk about. For now, I'll start with academics.

### 2a. Academics

Freshmen year. Every teacher I had taught me something new, and I really have no complaints against any of my teachers. What Mr. Koegle taught about biology and health is definitely what still sticks with me today. His teaching style, his approachability, etc. COC classes were also pretty chill, nothing too hard yet.

Sophomore year. I have to say that I felt like it was too easy in a sense? What Mrs. O'Shea taught was pretty much a repeat of what we did in english last year. Mrs. Rubay didn't really teach at all to be honest. She would just give us packets and projects to do. I liked Ms. Siner though, I feel like she taught well, and her class was pretty light. COC did kinda ramp up as I took precalc and calc, but it was all doable. Teachers were all understanding about COC classes and I liked that we had plenty of advisement and open period time to do homework.

Junior year. I think I had the best teachers this year. Mrs. Garvar and Dr. Shapiro are truly the only ones carrying AOC's reputation of being academically rigorous. Mrs. Garvar's english class is what really taught me how to write and I learned so much about modern history in Dr. Shapiro's. I loved that they blended their two classes and their teaching styles really appealed to me. COC, of course, got even tougher with now calc 2, calc 3 and physics (giving me my first B!!!) NEVER take hybrid physics.

Senior year. The final year. All the classes were pretty chill as we got college apps and stuff going on (speaking of college apps, I'll probably do a separate post on that and about my own experience with the process). My only complaint is probably about Mr. Worby's way of teaching econ. He could've done so much with that class, but in the end, all we did were packets.

Overall, I think all the AOC teachers I had cared about me and my life outside of class. They were all understanding, and I would say I learned at least a few new things in all of their classes. I also like the project based learning component of AOC's curriculum, and I hope that stays the same for the future.
