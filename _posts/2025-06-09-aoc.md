## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone. If you didn't know, I recently graduated from Academy of the Canyons (AOC) this month. I thought it would be interesting to reflect on my AOC experience, as well as ask some of my friends about their thoughts, so that's what this post is going to be about.

## 2. My thoughts

Honestly, I'm not sure where to start. There is just so much about AOC that we can talk about. For now, I'll start with academics.

### 2a. Academics

Freshmen year. Every teacher I had taught me something new, and I really have no complaints against any of my teachers. What Mr. Koegle taught about biology and health is definitely what still sticks with me today. His teaching style, his approachability, etc. COC classes were also pretty chill, nothing too hard yet.

Sophomore year. I have to say that I felt like it was too easy in a sense? What Mrs. O'Shea taught was pretty much a repeat of what we did in english last year. Mrs. Rubay didn't really teach at all to be honest. She would just give us packets and projects to do. I liked Ms. Siner though, I feel like she taught well, and her class was pretty light. COC did kinda ramp up as I took precalc and calc, but it was all doable. Teachers were all understanding about COC classes and I liked that we had plenty of advisement and open period time to do homework.

Junior year. I think I had the best teachers this year. Mrs. Garvar and Dr. Shapiro are truly the only ones carrying AOC's reputation of being academically rigorous. Mrs. Garvar's english class is what really taught me how to write and I learned so much about modern history in Dr. Shapiro's. I loved that they blended their two classes and their teaching styles really appealed to me. COC, of course, got even tougher with now calc 2, calc 3 and physics (giving me my first B!!!) NEVER take hybrid physics.

Senior year. The final year. All the classes were pretty chill as we got college apps and stuff going on (speaking of college apps, I'll probably do a separate post on that and about my own experience with the process). My only complaint is probably about Mr. Worby's way of teaching econ. He could've done so much with that class, but in the end, all we did were packets. Academics wise, oh my days. Afternoon physics is very soul crushing, but it was a pretty enjoyable and unique experience. Lin alg and diff eq are both pretty light classes I would say if you take them with the right professors.

Overall, I think all the AOC teachers I had cared about me and my life outside of class. They were all understanding, and I would say I learned at least a few new things in all of their classes. I also like the project based learning component of AOC's curriculum, and I hope that stays the same for the future. 

### 2b. Extracurriculars

I'll start off with saying that AOC has very, very limited ECs (extracurriculars) that you can do. Yeah, there are a decent number of clubs, but other than that, we have to go to other schools to participate in things like JROTC. Even SOAR (which a lot of AOC students do), is outside of school time. Robotics too, we have to go to West Ranch. 

I mostly participated in clubs, so I will speak on that. I knew I wanted to go into the STEM field, and AOC basically has 2 STEM clubs: Imagining the Future and Math & Physics. That's it. I joined those 2 clubs, and I was fortunate enough to gain leadership in both. I love both of these clubs and I've made so many friends and met new people in both. These clubs are I would say were the best part of my AOC experience. 

To talk briefly about college apps, I feel like AOC having limited clubs kinda worked in my favor. I took advantage of all the opportunities I had (which were these 2 clubs) and was involved in both of them as much as I possibly could, which I think helped me at the end of the day.

There are many clubs at COC, that I wish I had joined, like the NASA Astrophysics Team. This one is definitely one of my biggest regrets as it's one of the coolest things COC offers and is a door to so many opportunities, but I passed up on it.
