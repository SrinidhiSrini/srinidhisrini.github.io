## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone. For my first post, I thought I would write briefly about a presentation I gave at the College of the Canyons Star Party regarding the evidence of water on Europa. 

Europa is one of the four moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo Galilei (and Simon Marius) in 1610. Due to its smooth surface, scientists long suspected there to be a subsurface ocean and hopefully, life in the form of single-celled organisms and other bacteria-like creatures in that ocean.

## 2. Spectroscopy
The Hubble Space Telescope discovered evidence of water vapor using a technique called ultraviolet spectroscopy. This method studies how light interacts with matterâ€”especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, which is invisible to the human eye.

In space, water molecules can break apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms when exposed to energy like sunlight. This process, called photodissociation, happens often in places like icy moon plumes or thin atmospheres.

When hydrogen and oxygen atoms form, they absorb and emit light at very specific UV wavelengths. These are like atomic fingerprints, and Hubble can detect them. By analyzing the light from distant objects, scientists found spectral lines that match those of hydrogen and oxygen, which strongly suggests that water vapor had recently broken apart nearby.
