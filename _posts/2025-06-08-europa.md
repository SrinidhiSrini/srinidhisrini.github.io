## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone. For my first post, I thought I would write briefly about a presentation I gave at the College of the Canyons Star Party regarding the evidence of water on Europa. 

Europa is one of the four moons discovered by Galileo Galilei (and Simon Marius) in 1610. Due to its smooth surface, scientists long suspected there to be a subsurface ocean and hopefully, life in the form of single-celled organisms and other bacteria like creatures in that ocean.
