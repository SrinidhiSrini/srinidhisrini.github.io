## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone. For my first post, I thought I would write briefly about a presentation I gave at the College of the Canyons Star Party regarding the evidence of water on Europa. 

Europa is one of the four moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo Galilei (and Simon Marius) in 1610. Due to its smooth surface, scientists long suspected there to be a subsurface ocean and hopefully, life in the form of single-celled organisms and other bacteria-like creatures in that ocean.

## 2. Spectroscopy
The Hubble Space Telescope discovered evidence of water vapor using a technique called ultraviolet spectroscopy. This method studies how light interacts with matter—especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, which is invisible to the human eye.

In space, water molecules can break apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms when exposed to energy like sunlight. This process, called photodissociation, happens often in places like icy moon plumes or thin atmospheres.

When hydrogen and oxygen atoms form, they absorb and emit light at very specific UV wavelengths. These are like atomic fingerprints, and Hubble can detect them. By analyzing the light from distant objects, scientists found spectral lines that match those of hydrogen and oxygen, which strongly suggests that water vapor had recently broken apart nearby.

## 3. Magnetic Field Measurements
When NASA’s Galileo spacecraft flew past Europa, its magnetometer detected an unexpected disturbance in Jupiter’s magnetic field near the moon. Under normal circumstances, Jupiter's strong magnetic field should pass through a non-conductive body like rock or ice without much interference. However, the observed anomalies indicated that something within Europa was interacting with Jupiter’s field.

Using Maxwell’s equations—the fundamental laws governing electromagnetism—scientists modeled how a conductive material could induce its own magnetic field in response to Jupiter’s. The best explanation was the presence of a subsurface, electrically conductive layer. Since salty water is a good conductor of electricity, this led to the strong hypothesis that Europa has a global ocean of liquid, salt-rich water beneath its icy shell.

## 4. Surface Geology and Ice Movement

High-resolution images from Galileo revealed a surface crisscrossed with long, intersecting cracks, ridges, and disrupted terrain that looks like floating icebergs. These features don’t resemble impact craters or typical tectonic processes. Instead, scientists applied physical modeling—specifically fracture mechanics, ice dynamics, and heat transfer equations—to understand these structures.

Their models showed that tidal flexing from Jupiter’s immense gravitational pull causes Europa’s interior to stretch and compress rhythmically. This mechanical stress generates frictional heating, particularly at the boundary between the icy shell and the underlying layer, which helps to maintain a liquid ocean. The shifting and cracking of the ice are consistent with behavior expected above a fluid or slushy layer, similar to how Earth's polar ice sheets deform over oceans.
